\section*{Summary of Uncertainty Statistics for Empirical Correlations}

For each quantity of interest, the experimental uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}\sb{E}$, model uncertainty, $\widetilde{\sigma}\sb{M}$, and model bias are shown in Table~\ref{summary_stats}. The latter two values indicate the average scatter and bias of the model predictions. For example, for a given quantity, a model uncertainty of 0.15 indicates that one standard deviation of all of the model predictions is equal to 15~\%, and a model bias of 1.05 indicates that, on average, the model tends to overpredict that quantity by 5~\%. The number of datasets and data points are also listed for each quantity.
